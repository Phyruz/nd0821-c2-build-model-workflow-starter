# Udacity ML DevOps Nanodegree

This repositories contains all the project related to the [ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821) offered by Udacity.

## Structure 

Each folder in this repository contains all the code, directories and files related to each of the program's projects, namely:
1. [Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code](https://github.com/Phyruz/udacity-mldevops/tree/main/predict_churn_with_clean_code)
2. Build an ML Pipeline for Short-term Rental Prices in NYC (WIP)
3. Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI (WIP)
4. A Dynamic Risk Assessment System (WIP)

### 1. Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code

In this project, I implemented clean code practices in the context of implementing a customer churn prediction model. The completed project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).
